When I made and saved the edit that I did to a tile, on the tileset template it showed up all blurry and anti-aliased. This happens even when I just re save the tiles without editing them. The layers are still saved as .psb files and the template is still saved as a psd. EDIT: Figured it out. You have to go to Edit -> Preferences -> General and switch Image Interpolation as Nearest Neighbor. Leaving this up in case others have my problem
